- Introduction -

Textual is a highly modified version of the open source project known 
as LimeChat. The user interface is tailored towards users that have 
used darker themes of the Windows IRC client mIRC. The design of the 
client is mostly based around the open standard of WebKit which means 
it can be themed using CSS and JavaScript. Support for IRC commands 
based off AppleScript is also supported.

--------------

- Compiling -

Textual compiles as any normal application except for one exception. Code Signing is used since Textual uses keychain access so the certificate that is used to do the sign must be placed in keychain. The certificate can be found in the folder Extra/Code Signing/ - Simply double click to open and install. After it is installed compiling can be done.

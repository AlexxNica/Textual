#### Introduction ####

Textual is a highly modified version of the open source project known 
as LimeChat. The user interface is tailored towards users that have 
used darker themes of the Windows IRC client mIRC. The design of the 
client is mostly based around the open standard of WebKit which means 
it can be themed using CSS and JavaScript. Support for IRC commands 
based off AppleScript is also supported.

#### Compiling Requirements ####

Textual uses the BWToolkit plugin in order to add new user interface 
elements to its library. Therefore, before compiling make sure that the 
"BWToolkit.ibplugin" file has been loaded into the Interface Builder 
application. This file can be found in the folder "Frameworks/BWToolkit/"

Developers that chose to compile the Textual source code using version 
4.0 of Xcode and later are asked to set Xcode to place the build 
product of each compile in the location specified by the targets. 
This setting can be changed by going to the File menu and then 
Project Settings. If this is not done, then the plugins will not 
be compiled in correct location for Textual to copy over. 

#### Friendly Request ####

It is asked that those with knowledge of compiling Textual do not 
abuse it to distribute binaries to large groups of users during the
time period that it is exclusive to the Apple Mac App Store.

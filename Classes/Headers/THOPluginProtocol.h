 Textual's own API. TPILS takes a single paramater and that is the key to look inside 
 the .strings file for. TPIFLS takes a key then as many paramaters as needed after. 
 TPIFLS takes the key given, finds the localized string, then formats it similar to 
 NSString stringWithFormat:… 
 
 These calls expect the localized strings to be inside the filename "BasicLanguage.strings"
 Any other name will not work unless the actual cocoa APIs for accessing localized strings
 is used in place of these. */

 isThemeReload informs the call whether the insertion occured during a style
 reload. Style reloads occur when a style is changed and the entire view has
 to have each message repopulated.
 
 isHistoryReload informs the call whether the insertion occured when the view
 was first initalized and it was part of the data from previous session being
 reloaded into the view. 
 
 It is NOT recommended to do any heavy work when isThemeReload and isHistoryReload
 is YES as these events have thousands of messages being processed.
 
 These events are posted on the dispatch queue associated with the internal plugin
 manager. They are never received on the main thread. IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT
 TO REMEMBER THIS BECAUSE WEBKIT REQUIRES MODIFICATIONS TO THE DOM TO OCCUR ON THE
 MAIN THREAD. So yeah, if you are are doing anything in inside this method that
 involves accessing this message, then do so on main thread. */
